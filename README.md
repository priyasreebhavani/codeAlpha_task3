# #Network Intrusion Detection system using snort

A Network Intrusion Detection System (NIDS) is a security solution designed to monitor network traffic for signs of unauthorized or malicious activity. NIDS operates by inspecting inbound and outbound network traffic and comparing it against predefined signatures or behavioral patterns indicative of known attacks or suspicious behavior. When potential threats are detected, NIDS generates alerts or takes appropriate actions to mitigate the risk.

NIDS can be deployed at strategic points within a network, such as at network perimeters, within internal network segments, or at critical network junctions. It continuously analyzes network traffic, looking for anomalies, unauthorized access attempts, malware activity, denial-of-service (DoS) attacks, and other security breaches.
Key features and components of NIDS include:
Packet Capture and Analysis
Signature-Based Detection
Anomaly-Based Detection
Alerting and Reporting
Response and Mitigation
Continuous Monitoring and Updates
